## When to Use

- Project kickoff and initiation
- Weekly/monthly status updates
- Major milestone achievements
- Changes to scope, timeline, or budget
- Risks or issues requiring escalation
- Stakeholder onboarding
- Handling difficult conversations

### 4. **Difficult Conversations**

```markdown
## Handling Difficult Stakeholder Conversations

### Preparing for Difficult Conversations

1. **Gather Facts**
   - Be clear about the issue/change
   - Have data to support your position
   - Understand implications for stakeholder

2. **Anticipate Reactions**
   - What concerns might arise?
   - What are valid pain points?
   - What mitigations can you offer?

3. **Plan the Conversation**
   - One-on-one preferred for sensitive topics
   - Choose appropriate timing and location
   - Prepare talking points
   - Identify decision-maker authority

### Delivering Bad News

Bad News Template:

1. **Context** (30 seconds)
   - What is the situation?
   - Why are we discussing this?

2. **The News** (Direct & Clear)
   - State clearly what's changed
   - Provide specific impact
   - Avoid softening language

3. **Root Cause** (if applicable)
   - Explain what happened
   - Take responsibility if appropriate
   - Avoid blame

4. **Impact Assessment**
   - Timeline impact
   - Budget impact
   - Scope impact

5. **Mitigation Plan**
   - What will you do about it?
   - Specific actions & timeline
   - How will you prevent recurrence?

6. **Next Steps**
   - What decisions are needed?
   - When will you follow up?
   - How can stakeholder help?

### Example Conversation

**Issue:** Timeline extension needed (2 weeks)

"Thank you for your time. I need to share an important update about
our timeline.

We've discovered that the integration with the payment system requires
more extensive security hardening than initially estimated. We've run
performance tests and determined we need an additional 2 weeks to meet
our security and compliance requirements.

This impacts our delivery date from March 15 to March 29. Budget impact
is minimal ($8K for additional testing).

Here's what we're doing to manage this: We're running security tests
in parallel with development, we've engaged the security team early,
and we've built in validation checkpoints to catch issues early.

The alternative is to launch with reduced security, which we cannot
recommend given our risk profile.

I need your approval to proceed with the extended timeline. Can we
schedule a 30-minute call with you and the executive team tomorrow
to discuss?"
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Tailor messages to stakeholder interests and influence
- Communicate proactively, not reactively
- Be transparent about issues and risks
- Provide regular scheduled updates
- Document decisions and communication
- Acknowledge stakeholder concerns
- Follow up on action items
- Build relationships outside crisis mode
- Use multiple communication channels
- Celebrate wins together

### ❌ DON'T
- Overcommunicate or undercommunicate
- Use jargon stakeholders don't understand
- Surprise stakeholders with bad news
- Promise what you can't deliver
- Make excuses without solutions
- Communicate through intermediaries for critical issues
- Ignore feedback or concerns
- Change communication style inconsistently
- Share inappropriate confidential details
- Communicate budget/timeline bad news via email

## Communication Tips

- Schedule communication at consistent times
- Use visual dashboards for metrics
- Record important conversations
- Share why, not just what changed
